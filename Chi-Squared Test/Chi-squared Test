# Load Data
```{r}
df <- read.csv('survey.csv')
print(head(df))
```

# inputing NA 

```{r}
#complete.cases(df) #not recommended, because it looks like a lazy work
df1 <- df[complete.cases(df), ]
head(df1)
```

# Hypothesis

* H<sub>0</sub> = There is no significant relationship between W.Hand and Clap. (Accepted if p-value > 0.05)
* H<sub>1</sub> = There is a significant relationship between W.Hand and Clap. (Accepted if p-value < 0.05)

# Inferential Test

```{r}
result <- chisq.test(table(c(df1[5], df1[8])))
print(result)
```
```{r}
p.value <- result[["p.value"]]
print(p.value)
```

# Conclusion

So, there is a significant correlation between W.Hand and Clap. Because `r p.value` is lower than 0.05.
