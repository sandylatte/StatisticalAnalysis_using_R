# Load Data
```{r}
df <- read.csv('survey.csv')
print(head(df))
```

# Data Cleaning (Excluding NA)

```{r}
#complete.cases(df) #not recommended, because it looks like a lazy work
df1 <- df[complete.cases(df), ]
head(df1)
```

# Hypothesis

* H<sub>0</sub> = There is no significant correlation between Wr.Hand and Height. (Accepted if correlation = 0)
* H<sub>1</sub> = There is a correlation between Wr.Hand and Height. (Accepted if correlation != 0)

# Inferential Test

```{r}
cor(df1$Wr.Hnd, df1$Height)
```

# Conclusion

So, there is a less significant positive correlation between Wr.Hand and Height.

```{r}
df2 <- df1[c(3, 4, 7, 11, 13)]
head(df2)
```

```{r}
cor(df2)
