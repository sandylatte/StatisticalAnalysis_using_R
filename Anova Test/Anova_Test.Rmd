# Load Data
```{r}
df <- read.csv('anova.csv')
print(head(df))
```

Relevant Data 1

```{r}
df1 <- df[-1]
head(df1)
```

Melting Data

```{r}
library(reshape2)

df2 <- melt(df1)
print(df2)
```

# Hypothesis

* H<sub>0</sub> = There is no significant variance between vendor A, B, and C. (Accepted if p-value > 0.05)
* H<sub>1</sub> = There is a significant variance between vendor A, B, and C. (Accepted if p-value < 0.05)

# Inferential Test

```{r}
library(easyanova)
ea1(df2)
```

# Conclusion

So, there is no significant variance between vendor A, B, and C.
