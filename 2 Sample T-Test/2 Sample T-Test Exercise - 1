Source of Data Frame

```{r}
df <- read.csv("T Test - 1.csv")
head(df)
```

feature = nilai_sd_1 as df1

```{r}
df1 <- df[3]
head(df1)
```

feature = nilai_sd_jogja as df2

```{r}
df2 <- df[2]
head(df2)
```

# Hypothesis

* H<sub>0</sub> = There is no significant difference between sd 1 and sd jogja. (Accepted if p-value > 0.05)
* H<sub>1</sub> = There is a significant difference between sd 1 and sd jogja. (Accepted if p-value < 0.05)

# Inferential Statistics

We will use 2 Sample T-Test because we only 2 raw data.

```{r}
#print(t.test(data1, data2))
print(t.test(df2, df1))
```

In conclusion, there is a significant difference between sd 1 and sd jogja.
